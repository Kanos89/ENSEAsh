**Personal report**

  This lab report was co-written by myself and the use of AI Assistant in CLion (based on openai-gpt-4o), this tool was very accurate in solving problems such as redundancy in the prompt printed in each line, which tended to accumulate (and of course helped the lack of knowledge from the student writing this report).
  
  A small mention to the shortcut ALT + ENTER was very usefull to find any library to include without effortlessly, a very efficient tool of CLion.
  
  One thing I found difficult was switching between .c as the lab progressed, by that I mean that in the beginning Q2 needed to print the start_line prompt, read and execute the command entered. Then we had to add a parameter to it to transfer the "command" input to check if we want to "exit" in question 3 (which is another .c file).
  
  Another step was to destroy the executive function of question 2 to execute and monitor the time of the execution process in question 5 (otherwise we'd be executing the command twice, which is not what we want), so now question 2 will only "initiate" the start prompt if there is no duration to print.
